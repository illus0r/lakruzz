## To be or not to be - an entrepreneur

José tells that this place came to live by a misconception this is not really who they are. They used be teachers.

I have to correct him. Look around.

Cinta and José strikes me as genuine entrepreneurs, they build a place that the whole local community now depends upon, they have more than 20 people employed and they have really done a lot of innovative marketing gimmicks that make this place stand out.

I list them to him:

- A 2 meter high local map on wall showing Dewalokam in the center of everything.
"That's Cinta's idea" he replies
- Yoga in the morning.
"That's Cinta" he laughs af if he's trying to prove that he's not an entrepreneur.
- The sign in the rear window of Siby's car showing the name and logo of Dewalokam
"Thats' Siby's own idea"
- The Cookbook
"That's Cinta"
- The garden
"That's me he laughs"

We continue this game for a while but Cinta is now joining the conversation I sense that they actually are aware of the fact that running two jobs along running an organic farm and a homestay for more than 20 guests and providing employment for 20 people probably is a bit of a mouthful and as far as they have come now, and the success they have had the past two years clearly indicates that there is really no turning back.

I hope I made my point clear.

Cinta asks about mountain biking - Chewang and I get really enthusiastic
